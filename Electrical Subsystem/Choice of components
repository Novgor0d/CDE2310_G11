# Choice of components:
1) We chose AMG8833 temperature sensor because:
  -Gives an 8x8 grid of temperature points.
  -Has low Power Consumption 
  -Has a good temperature range of -20°C to 80°C.
  -Frame rate: 10 Frames/sec
  -Has built-in ADC, so need to for an external ADC on the raspberry pi.
(For Simple and Budget-friendly heat detection)

2) The two 12V motors (JGB37-520) are used for flywheels.

3) The L298N motor driver is to control the two 12V flywheel motors. 

4) The SG90 servo motor is used in the rack and pinion mechanism, to push the platform holding the ball, up to the flywheel.
