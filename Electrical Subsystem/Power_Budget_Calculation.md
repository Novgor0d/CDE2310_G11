##  Power Budget Calculations

### **Assumptions**
- **Battery efficiency**: 80%
- **Boot-up time**: 20 seconds  
- **Stand-by time**: 50 seconds  
- **Operation time**: 30 seconds

---

### **Calculation**
(8.4 × 20) + (5.9 × 50) + (13 × 30) + (10.22 × T) = 11.1 × 1.8 × 3600 × 0.8 => T = 92.3 minutes

This means after one complete charge, the **TurtleBot** is expected to run for approximately **92.3 minutes**.
