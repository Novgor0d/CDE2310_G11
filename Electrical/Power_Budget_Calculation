Following are the calculations for power budget:
Assumptions: 
  Battery efficiency = 80%
  Boot up time = 20 s
  Stand-by time = 50 s
  Operation time = 30 s

Calculation: 
(8.4*20) + (5.9*50) + (13*30) + (10.22*T) = 11.1*1.8*3600*0.8
=> T = 92.3 minutes
This means after one complete charge, the turtlebot is expected to run for 92.3 minutes. 

Note: Please refer to 'Power_Budget_Table' file for the power distribution of each component, which has been used in the above calculations.
